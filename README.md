# AutoMCServer

This is a project for those who don't know have the technical knowledge to create a Minecraft Server or who don't want to.

Please leave any comments/suggestions on how I could improve this project. (It's appreciated)

Thanks for using my work!

# Instructions

# **Warning: This only works on linux/debian devices**.  Windows is in developement.

After you download the project:
1. Extract it into whatever folder you want to.

2. Open the command line and navigate to the directory.

3. Run **python3 script_main.py** in the terminal. Note - If you don't have Python installed, go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for help.

4. The terminal will prompt you for your password, so make sure you know it.

5. The terminal will then ask you if you want to accept the EULA, type **Yes** or **No**.

6. After a few more seconds it should then start up the minecraft server.

7. Connect to it in minecraft by typing in the ip that the program will print out into the *server address* box.

8. It should then pop up. Note - If it does not pop up or it says *Can't Resolve Hostname*/*Can't Connect To Server* then you aren't plugged into LAN/Ethernet. Also, you can't use this server over Wi-fi if you want to make it public.

# Thanks Again! And, remember, questions/comments are appreciated.
